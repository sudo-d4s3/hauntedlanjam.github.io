		<h3>Will there be a Game Jam this year?</h3>
		<p>Officially: Not this year.</p>
		<p>However, if you and a group want to have an unofficial Game Jam at the LAN you're more than welcome too!</p>
		<br />
		<h3>Hackers will be here? Will we be safe?</h3>
		<p>Yes there will be hackers and yes you and your electronics will be safe.</p>
		<p>Most hackers aren't criminals. A hacker is simply someone who makes a computer do something it wasn't designed to do.</p>
